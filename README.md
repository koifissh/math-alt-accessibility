# Accessible Math Expressions
Created by Daniel, Josh, Zeke

## Project Overview
Accessible Math Expressions is a web-based tool designed to make mathematical expressions more accessible to all users, particularly those with visual impairments or learning disabilities. The application bridges the gap between mathematical notation and accessible content by converting LaTeX mathematical expressions into both visual representations and descriptive alternative text.

## Core Features

### LaTeX Input System
- **Interactive Input Interface**: A dedicated text area for entering LaTeX mathematical expressions
- **Smart Component Shortcuts**: Quick-access buttons organized by mathematical categories:
  - Arithmetic operations and basic symbols
  - Trigonometric functions
  - Calculus notation
  - Greek letters
- **Real-time Preview**: Immediate visual feedback of the entered expression

### Visual Rendering
- **Professional Typesetting**: Uses KaTeX for high-quality mathematical notation display
- **Responsive Layout**: Clean, two-column design showing both input and output
- **Theme Support**: Toggle between light and dark modes for comfortable viewing

### Accessibility Features

#### Alternative Text Generation
- **Intelligent Parsing**: Converts LaTeX expressions into natural, readable text
- **Context-Aware Description**: Maintains mathematical meaning while providing clear verbal descriptions
- **Semantic Grouping**: Organizes mathematical components for better comprehension

#### Visual Accessibility
- **Color-Coded Components**: Mathematical elements are highlighted by category:
  - Functions (Blue)
  - Operators (Red)
  - Comparisons (Purple)
  - Mathematical symbols (Green)
- **Optional Word Blurring**: Helps users focus on specific parts of expressions
- **Font Customization**: Multiple font options including:
  - OpenDyslexic for improved readability
  - Arial
  - Comic Sans MS
  - Verdana

#### Audio Accessibility
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Natural verbalization of mathematical expressions
- **Interactive Word Selection**: Click individual words to hear them spoken
- **Progressive Highlighting**: Visual tracking of spoken words
- **Playback Controls**: Start, stop, and navigate through audio playback

## Use Cases

### Educational Support
- Assists students with different learning styles
- Provides multiple ways to understand mathematical concepts
- Supports both visual and auditory learning

### Accessibility Compliance
- Helps educational institutions meet accessibility requirements
- Makes mathematical content available to screen reader users
- Provides alternative formats for mathematical documentation

### Learning Aid
- Helps users understand LaTeX syntax
- Provides immediate feedback on mathematical notation
- Supports self-paced learning of mathematical concepts

## Technical Implementation
- Built with modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and updates
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Local storage for user preferences
- No server-side dependencies

## Best Practices
- Follows WCAG accessibility guidelines
- Implements ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility
- Provides keyboard navigation support
- Maintains high contrast ratios for readability
- Includes clear visual feedback for all interactions
